      Leary and the cow that kicked over the lamp that caused the great fire in
      Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Leary got her living by selling milk; she had five cows, and kept
      them in her barn on De Koven street, on the west side of the river. A
      neighbor woman called on her for a pint of milk at nine o'clock Sunday
      night, October 8th, and Mrs. Leary, having sold all she had, went to the
      barn with her lamp to make a further draft on her best cow. The cow, as
      seen by the picture, being a spirited animal, became indignant at the
      attempt, kicked over the lamp, setting the barn on fire, and thus
      inaugurated the greatest fire the world has ever seen."]

      He will cut down your claims, he will cut up your proofs,
    </p>
    <p>
      He will riddle your case through its warps and its woofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And search all your houses from cellars to roofs
    </p>
    <p>
      For a sliver by which he may fasten a quibble
    </p>
    <p>
      And curtail your claim to a bite or a nibble.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then when you think he is ready for payment
    </p>
    <p>
      He will make you regret you were ever a claimant,
    </p>
    <p>
      By charging you discount for those sixty days,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or vexing you further with needless delays.
    </p>
    <p>
      These awful adjusters! they should be ashamed
    </p>
    <p>
      To ply a vocation so loudly defamed.

      "What's the good of insurance if not to pay losses?
    </p>
    <p>
      And why all these questions, and bothers and crosses?
    </p>
    <p>
      And why are we hampered and why are we checked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurers can claim (if you'll only reflect)
    </p>
    <p>
      No rights which it is not <i>our</i> right to reject;
    </p>
    <p>
      No rights which the people are bound to respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must smile and be patient, and out with their purses,
    </p>
    <p>
      And take what we give them, our kicks or our curses;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bow down to the cow with the old crumpled horn
    </p>
    <p>
      That kicked over the lamp that set fire to the barn
    </p>

      That caused the Great Fire in Chicago!"

      For the woes which the fire-stricken city befel,
